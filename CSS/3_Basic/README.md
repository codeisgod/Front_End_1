# Introduction to CSS

Stands for Cascading Style Sheets.  
It is a language to define styles like font, size, spacing, colors, etc to HTML elements   

Three ways of specifying styles   
**Inline** - Using style attribute (already did in last section)   
**Internal** - Using <style> tag in the head of any HTML document    
**External** - Specifying the styles in a separate .css file.    
CSS is written inside curly braces {} and in key value pairs which end in a semicolon
