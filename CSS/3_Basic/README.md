Three Types of CSS

Inline CSS: css applied within HTML tab element  
Internal CSS: CSS within style element   
External CSS: CSS within .css file   

# Inline style
Can be done in many ways using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)   
Each element can have a style attribute to specify styles like font, size, color, etc.   
<tagname style="property:value;">   
The property can be any valid CSS property and value is a CSS value (we will see many properties later)    

<p style="color: tomato;">
    Cupcake ipsum dolor sit amet cotton candy tootsie roll pudding. Sesame
    snaps caramels sweet roll marshmallow tiramisu. Donut
</p>

This is called as inline styling in HTML
