<!--

    Flexbox is used to layout, align, and distribute space among items in a container.
It is useful when the size of the container/items is unknown and/or dynamic.
Flexbox is well-suited for application components like inside the navbar, or forms, or cards etc
Flexbox is made up of two main components
Flexbox Parent (Container)
Flexbox Children (Items)

Start by defining display: flex to a block element (like div)

<nav></nav> 

/* CSS */
nav {
    display: flex;
}

Using display: flex property will do two main things
It will make the block element a flex container â†’ which will hold the properties which define the direction, and the layout of the items.
Set the main axis, hence will define the direction of the items. Default left-to-right. The other axis will be called the cross-axis (we will understand its use later)
