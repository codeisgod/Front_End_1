<!--
    If at any point you wish to override the properties
 inherited from the parent 
or due to specificity.
We can use the !important property in CSS which overrides all the CSS rules.
p {
 color: gold !important;
}

p {
 color: red;
}
We should avoid using !important since this messes with the predictability of our code.
