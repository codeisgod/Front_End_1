<!--
    Some properties are inherited down the HTML while others are not.
        Styles that are inherited are generally related to the styling of the document text.
            Example Fonts and colors

        Styles that are not inherited are usually related to the appearance of elements.
            Parameters for positioning, sizes, margins, backgrounds, and frames:
            Example width, height, border, padding, margin, position, and others

        Do not confuse this with the fact that block elements take all the available width
