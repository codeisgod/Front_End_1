<!-- 
CSS Grid is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system.
It helps place the rectangular elements on a web page in complex manners.
A grid is made up of 6 important elements
    Grid Container (Parent)
    Grid Item (Children)
    Grid Rows (the horizontal parts)
    Grid Columns (the vertical parts)
    Grid Lines - which divide the rows and columns
    Grid Cell - Space between two adjacent row and two adjacent column grid lines
