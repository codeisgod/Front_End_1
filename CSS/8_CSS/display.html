<!-- 
Since every element on the page is a rectangular box, the display property determines how that box behaves.
It holds some common values like
    inline → Make the box an inline element  -> make the box in line with text
    block → Makes the box a block element    -> get whole new line and act as box
    inline-block → Makes the box a block element which would behave like inline elements.   ->  it can same as inline but we can set height and width and it will applicable
    flex → Makes the element behave like a flexbox container
    grid → Makes the element behave like a grid container
