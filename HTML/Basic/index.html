            Ordered or Numbered Lists created by <ol>
                Each item under the list must be enclosed in its own <li> tag to denote it as a list item.

        Types of Unordered Lists in HTML
        There are four main values of the list-style property that help us with this customization:

LIST-STYLE	EFFECT
none	-> There will not be any bullets appearing in front of the list item
circle	-> A circular (hollow) bullet appears in front of the list item
disc	-> This is the default filled circular bullet
square	-> A filled square bullet appears in front of the list item
    -->

    <ul list-style="circle">
        <li>this is unordered list with Attribute</li>
        <li>pineApple</li>
        <li>Apple</li>
    </ul>

    
    <ol type="I">
        <li>this is ordered list with Attribute</li>
        <li>pineApple</li>

        We can define a description list using the <dl> tag element.
        Inside the <dl>..</dl> we need to define a description term using the <dt> tag.
        The term is usually some small text about something.
        Then, we can define the description descriptor to describe the term further using the <dd> tag.
