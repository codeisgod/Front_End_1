<!--
    For easy navigation between our content we should have an index page which shall help us navigate between the pages and their content easily.
In the root folder of your sandbox create a file index.html
Add to this index.html file 
h1 heading  - "Index of Crio FE-1 Sprint"
Create a list of two h3 headings with folder names - Session 1, Session 2
Using anchor tags with relative urls, link the session names to the index.html files of respective sessions, i.e. Clicking on Session 1 should route the user to /Session_1/index.html
Similarly on each page add an anchor tag at the end of the page saying "Back to index" and link it to the root index.html page.
