            <div> and <span>
                The <div> element is often used as a block container for other HTML elements.
                The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
                <div> and <span> have no required attributes.
                <div> and <span> both have no visual effect on browser.

            Semantic and Non Semantic Elements
                <div> and <span> are non-semantic elements 
                They do not describe anything about the content within them.

                Semantic elements in HTML5 clearly describe the content within them.
                Example - <section> <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <article>
                They work like block elements.
                
                Semantic describe type of content while reading html code 
                Semantic and nonsemantic both have no visual effect on browser
