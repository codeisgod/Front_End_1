# RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN

## Introduction to Responsive Web Design*
<ol>
    <li>
        A responsive website "responds" according to the screen size it is being rendered on.
    </li>
    <li>
        Designers generally provide mockups of a website which tell a developer how the website should look on different screens.
    </li>
    <li>
        To style the elements on the page depending on the screen size, we use the @media query in CSS.
    </li>
</ol>

## Ground Rules of responsive design
<ol>
    <li>
        Use relative units (like rem, %) in place of absolute units (px, pt)
    </li>
    <li>
        Use fluid containers for content as much as you can (i.e. flexbox)
    </li>
    <li>
        Try not to use fixed width and heights, use min- or max- counterparts instead.
    </li>
    <li>
        Design Mobile First - Mobiles are generally single column → Less CSS to be written.
        <ol>
            <li>
                Start with a small screen, then test on larger devices and see where the design "breaks", then add a breakpoint
            </li>
            <li>
                Use @media queries to define breakpoints of a page.
            </li>
        </ol>
